## Running the server
To run the server successfully, ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine. If you haven't installed MongoDB yet, you can download it from the official website.

Once MongoDB is installed, follow these steps to start the server:
Clone the repository (if you still haven't):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PetarPetrov01/Angular-Project
```
Navigate to the `server` folder:
```bash
cd .\server\
```
Install all dependencies:
```powershell
npm install
```
Run the server with the following command:
```powershell
npm start
```

Following a successful startup, the server writes the message:
'Connected to database
Server started on 3030'
